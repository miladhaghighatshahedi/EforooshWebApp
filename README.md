# EforooshWebApp

EF Web Application is based on Java Programming Language and its technologies and Frameworks.In this web app i used FrameWorks
such as Spring,Spring Security and Spring MVC design pattern , Hibernate , view technology as JSP and apache Tiles and since i 
dont want to learn view layer designing i used bootstrap.

EF Web App is a real working online Shopping Store that every client can view,add,remove items to a shopping cart and send save or send order.
The Admin and authority users can view order records and get reports.also admin and authority role can add,remove,update category,
sub category and items and get reports too.

This app can be blue print that any developer can extend and add new functionality as his/her needs and also it can be determind
as a starting point toward learning java web technology based  on spring,hibernate,jsp and jasper report.

tunning in hibernate query also should be done!
also EF Web App is under construction and optimization.
